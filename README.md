# 🧠 Cancer Risk Prediction System (Machine Learning Pipeline)

This project implements an **end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline** to predict **high cancer risk vs low cancer risk** using patient health data.  
It covers **data preprocessing, feature engineering, multi-model training, evaluation, model selection, and inference**.

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Problem Type:** Binary Classification (High Risk / Low Risk)
- **Target Variable:** `High_Risk` (derived from `Risk_Score`)
- **Dataset:** `AI_Brosnan_CancerDataset.xlsx`
- **Best Model Selection:** Based on cross-validation accuracy
- **Final Output:** Risk prediction with probability for new patients
